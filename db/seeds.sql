  (1, 'Zip Zap Zop', 'Zip, Zap, Zop is about focus and energy. As students pass the energy across the circle (in the form of a Zip, a Zap, or a Zop), they make eye contact with the person they send the energy to, and work together to keep the rhythm going. The activity also provides an opportunity to explore pace, specificity of choice, “energy” and sequence.\n\nInvite students to stand in a circle. Ask the group to repeat the words “Zip, Zap, Zop” three or four times, all together. Introduce the activity: Imagine that I have a bolt of energy in my hands. To start the game, I will send the bolt out of energy out of my body with a strong forward motion straight to someone else in the circle (use hands, body, eyes, and voice to make contact across the circle) and say, “Zip.” Explain that the next person takes the energy and passes it immediately to someone else saying “Zap.” That person passes it on to another participant with a “Zop.” The game continues and the “Zip, Zap, Zop” sequence is repeated as the energy moves around the circle.  Encourage all plays to use their whole body to send energy and to make eye contact. They can send the energy to whomever they want but the goal is to include all players. Practice the game. If there is a mistake, encourage students to simply resume playing without discussion. The group challenge is to go very quickly and stay consistent in rhythm; if students struggle, pause the game, discuss strategy and try again.', 'Warmup', NULL, 3, NULL, '2017-05-25 17:56:53'),

Ask for a location, or a profession, and have every player draw 3 of these slips. Players put these in their pockets without reading them.\n\nThen a scene is played, in which at any point in time, players replace what they might have said, by whatever is on the piece of paper they draw out of their pocket. Try to incorporate/justify whatever is your line into the scene.\n\nTry to avoid thinks like `My granny always said` - you want your character to say whatever is on the piece of paper - don`t try to put those words into someone else`s mouth.

Winners move up the evolutionary ladder (becoming tadpoles) while losers stay amoebas, and both of them move on to find another partner.

PROFIGLIANO deflects back to the player who passed it to you, but while making eye contact with a different player (as a fake out).

Once the second player thinks she knows the three things, she kills the first player with the weapon and calls in a third player, and then she tries to communicate the three things all over again.

This effect can be used in a variety of ways, including playing a scene with one or more set of Helping Hands, or having the players pretend to be an expert on a topic and demonstrate a task.
